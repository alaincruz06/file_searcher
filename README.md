# file_searcher

Simple utility to search specific files on your Android device using known file extensions.

## Inspiration

This project is a re-use of the Flutter package:

- [Flutter File Manager](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_file_manager)

This package was discontinued and no longer supports null-safety but I needed to use itÂ´s ability to search the device for specific files. Use it freely and free of charge. The original repo is located under:

- [MohamSayed/Flutter File Manager (GitHub)](https://github.com/MohamSayed/flutter_file_utils)
